/**
 * <h3>Threads and Locks</h3>
 * <p>
 *     While most of the discussion in the preceding chapters is concerned only with the behavior of code as executed a
 *     single statement or expression at a time, that is, by a single thread, the Java Virtual Machine can support many
 *     threads of execution at once.These threads independently execute code that operates on values and objects residing
 *     in a shared main memory. Threads may be supported by having many hardware processors, by time-slicing a single
 *     hardware processor, or by time-slicing many hardware processors.
 *
 *     Semantics: 语义
